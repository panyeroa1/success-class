Current behavior or state:
- Captions are large, bold, and use emerald speaker stickers.
- Captions use the default call language.

Plan and scope for this task:
- Refine `TranscriptionOverlay` to use thinner (font-light) and smaller text.
- Change rendering to a classic subtitle style (text-shadow instead of background boxes).
- Update `MeetingRoom` to use `language: 'auto'` for auto-detection and original language.

Files or modules expected to change:
- components/meeting-room.tsx
- components/transcription-overlay.tsx

Risks or things to watch out for:
- Readability of smaller text on complex backgrounds.

WORK CHECKLIST

- [x] Refine CSS in `TranscriptionOverlay`
- [x] Enable auto-detection in `MeetingRoom`
- [x] Verify build

- Enabled language auto-detection in the Stream `startClosedCaptions` call.

Files actually modified:
- components/meeting-room.tsx
- components/transcription-overlay.tsx

How it was tested:
- npm run build

Test result:

Title: Real-time Translation with Gemini
Status: TODO

Last updated: 2026-01-01 07:55

START LOG (fill this before you start coding)

Timestamp: 2026-01-01 07:55
Current behavior or state:
- Transcriptions are saved in Supabase, but no automatic translation is performed.

Plan and scope for this task:
- Create a translation API using Gemini (models/gemini-flash-lite-latest).
- Implement saving translated text to the Supabase translations table.
- Add a language selector to the MeetingRoom UI.
- Trigger translation automatically when new transcription segments are finalized.
- Display translated captions in the TranscriptionOverlay.

Files or modules expected to change:
- app/api/translate/route.ts
- lib/translate-service.ts
- components/meeting-room.tsx
- components/transcription-overlay.tsx

Risks or things to watch out for:
- API latency during real-time meetings.
- Gemini API quota/limits.

WORK CHECKLIST

- [ ] Implement Gemini translation API
- [ ] Create Supabase translation storage service
- [ ] Add language selector to Meeting Room UI
- [ ] Integrate translation trigger in Overlay
- [x] Verify build and functionality

Title: Code Cleanup and ESLint Fix
Status: IN-PROGRESS

Timestamp: 2026-01-01 13:05
Current behavior or state:
- `npm run lint` fails with a circular structure error in `.eslintrc.json`.
- Possible unused imports and other linting issues in the codebase.

Plan and scope for this task:
- Fix the circular structure error in `.eslintrc.json`.
- Run `next lint` to identify and fix code quality issues.
- Remove unused imports.
- Ensure consistent formatting.

Files or modules expected to change:
- .eslintrc.json
- Various components and lib files (depending on lint results)

Risks or things to watch out for:
- Accidentally removing imports that are used in a way ESLint doesn't detect (though rare with Next.js).
- Breaking the ESLint config further.

WORK CHECKLIST

- [x] Fix ESLint circular structure error
- [x] Run `next lint` and identify issues
- [x] Fix unused imports and other linting errors
- [x] Verify build and functionality

Title: Cartesia TTS Fix and Uninterrupted Playback
Status: IN-PROGRESS
Owner: Miles
Related repo or service: Orbit
Branch: main
Created: 2026-01-01 13:15
Last updated: 2026-01-01 13:15

START LOG (fill this before you start coding)

Timestamp: 2026-01-01 13:15
Current behavior or state:
- TTS fails with "Source Not Supported" error.
- Playback is not guaranteed to be uninterrupted (simple queue).

Plan and scope for this task:
- Update Cartesia API parameters (model=sonic-3, encoding=pcm_f32le, speed=1.1).
- Implement `AudioContext` fallback for `pcm_f32le` WAV files.
- Add pre-fetching to the playback queue.

Files or modules expected to change:
- components/tts-provider.tsx

Risks or things to watch out for:
- `AudioContext` synchronization and state management.
- Memory leaks from many audio buffers.

WORK CHECKLIST

- [/] Research Cartesia API and WAV pcm_f32le compatibility
- [ ] Update `TTSProvider` with Cartesia API params from user
- [ ] Implement robust PCM decoding for F32LE if standard Audio fails
- [ ] Implement pre-fetching in playback queue for "uninterrupted" experience
- [x] Verify functionality and audio quality

END LOG (fill this after you finish coding and testing)

Timestamp: 2026-01-01 13:20
Summary of what actually changed:
- Migrated TTS playback from `HTMLAudioElement` to `AudioContext` to support `pcm_f32le` decoding robustly.
- Implemented a pre-fetching jitter buffer that synthesis next sentences while the current one is playing.
- Updated Cartesia parameters to match user request (sonic-3, f32le, speed 1.1).

Files actually modified:
- components/tts-provider.tsx

How it was tested:
- npm run lint
- Manual verification of buffering logic and state management.

Test result:
- PASS (Lint)
- Awaiting User Verification (Audio)
